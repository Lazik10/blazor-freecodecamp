When do components render?

A1) When component is created
    - When page is first loaded
    - When page is refreshed
    - When we navigate to another page and then navigate back

A2) When components' events are triggered
    - It has to be an UI event (mouse click an so on) - It will not re-render if we use our own custom events (e.g. Timed event with Timer class)
    
    - IMPORTANT - If UI event is fired from parent component the child components will not re-render
    - EXCEPTION TO THIS BEHAVIOUR - RenderFragment component
                                  - if we trigger UI event in RenderFragment component which is in child component it will behave like if we 
                                    triggered that UI event from child component, that is why child component is re-rendered as well

A3) When components' parameter value has changed
    - When value of a member with [Parameter] attribute changes

A4) When developers manually trigger rendering
    - When we manually force the rendering with StateHasChanged() method
